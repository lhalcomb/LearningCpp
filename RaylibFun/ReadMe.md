These files were made to be ran on MacOS in May of 2024. 
These files are configured to be ran on ARM64 architecture with the M2 silicon chip
(Could also be ran on M1 or M3).

None of these files have been configured to run on windows or any linux distributions 

At the moment, this is where the project will be maintained on a Mac machine.

I apologized in advanced for the headache. Bear with me, I am new to C++ and C. 

This project was started in April of 2024. 
Here I am using the RayLib library to create video games and other graphics using C/C++.
This is for the sake of learning some real world development skills when it comes to C++. 

Words to the reader:

If you are reading this, you are probably a nerd like I am. You are also probably my friend, colleague, or family member. Therefore, I 
warn you ahead of time for any mistakes made in these files. Remember, this was for learning purposes. I am not a professional just quite yet. 
Anyways, if you do get it running, enjoy Space Invaders!!
