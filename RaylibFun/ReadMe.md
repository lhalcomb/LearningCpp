### 
These files were made to be ran on MacOS in May of 2024. 
These files are configured to be ran on ARM64 architecture with the M2 silicon chip
(Could also be ran on M1 or M3).

None of these files have been configured to run on windows or any linux distributions 

At the moment, this is where the project will be maintained on a Mac machine.

I apologized in advanced for the headache. Bear with me, I am new to C++ and C. 

This project was started in April of 2024. 
Here I am using the RayLib library to create video games and other graphics using C/C++.
This is for the sake of learning some real world development skills when it comes to C++. 

Words to the reader:

If you are reading this, you are probably a nerd like I am. You are also probably my friend, colleague, or family member. Therefore, I 
warn you ahead of time for any mistakes made in these files. Remember, this was for learning purposes. I am not a professional just quite yet. 
Anyways, if you do get it running, enjoy Space Invaders!!

Information on how to run this project: 

I used the raylib library for the game itself. I use the clang compiler to compile the C/C++ code. Therefore, the following is instructions on how I did it. In the future, I plan to make this compatible for linux and macOS. So you will see different sections throughout this file dedicated to the different operating systems. However, getting it to run on windows may be a little bit different with the MinGW compiler. I plan to have this project working on that too but for now. Linux and MacOS is my plan.
